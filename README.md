## 📁 File Structure

```
src/
│
├── components/
│   ├── Body.tsx           # Main component handling logic & layout
│   ├── CountBox.tsx       # Displays metrics (words, chars, etc.)
│   ├── LetterBox.tsx      # Displays individual letter frequencies
│   └── OptionBox.tsx      # Renders toggleable user options
│
├── countThings.ts         # Metric configuration (e.g., for CountBox)
├── requirements.ts        # Settings for toggles & limits
└── assets/ (optional)     # Icons or images (if used)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- **TextArea input** is monitored with `onChange`.
- **Letter frequency** is calculated using a filtered set of letters (ignores digits/symbols).
- **State-driven UI updates** display counts and toggleable analysis options.
- **Conditional rendering** shows warnings if the character limit is reached.
